# Hi lads! This is just a simple initializer for Pandora!

Just download start.sh, run it. It will automatically download things from the Github. During installation, macchanger will ask whether or not MAC addresses should be changed automatically - choose "No". The startup script in rc.local will perform this task more reliably.

After reboot, look for an access point named "Pandora Box". Password is "123123".
Connecting to it from an Apple or Android device should automatically bring up a captive portal login screen.
